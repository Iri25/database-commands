Using the tables and tree structure data is required in PostgreSQL:

1. To create a single table with all these data organized in the form of "adjacency list";
2. Displaying the name, the name of the parent and the level in the tree for all objects up to level 5;
3. With the help of a function/procedure, to transform this structure into "path enumeration" format (new table, additional coding can be used if needed, for example path separator;
4. For the "path enumeration" model, write a function that removes a given node as a parameter from structure with keeping the tree structure (not forest).
